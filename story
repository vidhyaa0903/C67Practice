Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived on a berry tree, on the banks of a river. 
In the same forest lived a crocodile and his wife. One day, the crocodile wanders deep into the river and comes to rest under the berry tree, on which the monkey lived.

The crocodile, having swum up quite a distance, was tired and hungry. The kind monkey sees that the crocodile is hungry and shares the berries with the crocodile. 
The crocodile eats the sweet berries, thanks the monkey, and goes back home.
